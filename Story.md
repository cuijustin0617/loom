Example Chat: User says: “I'm trying to group my customers based on their metadata ... ”; system says “You should use k-means clustering for grouping customers! It automatically finds groups in your metadata - just specify how many ...”
List of preview of summarized chats showing the topics, in the past week: How to cluster customers, Bayesian networks,How to cluster customers,How to cluster customers, Decision Trees Use Cases...
Learner memory graph: goal 1: Supervised Learning, courses [Define Supervised Learning…,Linear Regression Algorithm, Support Vector Machine Basics]; goal2: Decision Analysis, courses: [Setting up a Subjective Utility…, Making Use of a Decision Tree, Solving a Bayesian Network...]
Pass in both chats and learner graph into Prompt: “Pick topic & generate course:
- Identify recurring themes from chats
- Fit existing goals, avoid duplicates
- for each mini-course, Generate 3-4 modules personalized to user
- Return structured course JSON
”
Personalized Learning Materials: 1)  [strengthn mode] K-means Algorithm Overview, Module 1:  Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Module 2:  Segmenting Customers with K-means
Module 3: K-means Initialization & Convergence;
2)[explore mode] Influence Diagrams Overview, Module 1:  Building an Influence Diagram 
Module 2:
  Solving Influence Diagrams
Module 3:
  Decision Trees vs. Influence Diagrams
Pass both learner graph and lessons into prompt: Revise Learning Goals:
- Add knowledge under existing goals OR
- Expand + rename existing goal to include new related topic OR
- place ungrouped points under Others for later grouping
Updated graph/Long term mastery: goal 1(RENAMED):Machine Learning, courses/content: [Define Supervised Learning…, Linear Regression Algorithm, Support Vector Machine Basics, K-Means Algorithm Overview[NEW], Supervised vs. Unsupervised[NEW]]; goal 2: Decision Analysis, courses/content:[Setting up a Subjective Utility…, Making Use of a Decision Tree, Solving a Bayesian Network…, Influence Diagrams Overview[NEW], Comparing graphical Methods[NEW]]

To highlight – 
Personalization: since user asked about segmenting customers, the k means lecture is generated in context of segmenting customers
Long term: the new lessons and modules either address gaps in existing graph or try to link recent topics in chats with previous topics in graphs, under same goal – to give better holistic picture. – e.g. the suggested module of “supervised vs unsupervised learning” after seeing the user already learned supervised learning before, and is now learning k-means, or suggesting influence diagrams after seeing user learned decision trees and bayesian networks.
Dynamic graph: the regrouping of graph renamed “supervised learning” into “Machine learning“ after seeing the user learned K-means algo, which is unsupervised
