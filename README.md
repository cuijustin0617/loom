2. **Topic Decision & Course Outline** - Identifies learning opportunities using a dynamic learner memory graph
3. **Course Content Generation** - Creates personalized modules with lessons and quizzes
4. **Progress Tracking & Graph Updates** - Refines the learner model based on engagement and outcomes
