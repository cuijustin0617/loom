## ‚ú® STEP 3: Understanding LOOM

LOOM has **two modes**:

### üí¨ **CHAT Mode** (Default view)
- Use it like ChatGPT - ask questions, have conversations
- Supports multiple AI models (Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, GPT-4o-mini)
- Can attach images and PDFs
- All conversations are saved automatically

### üìö **LEARN Mode** (Click "Learn" in top navigation)
- **Automatically analyzes your chat history** to identify learning opportunities
- Suggests personalized course topics based on what you've discussed
- Creates structured learning paths with modules and quizzes
- Helps you consolidate and expand your knowledge

**How it works:** As you chat, LOOM tracks what you're learning about. When you switch to Learn mode, it suggests relevant topics and creates mini-courses to help you master those subjects.

## üß™ STEP 4: Testing Tasks

### Task 1: Have Natural Conversations (10+ messages)

**Use Chat mode like you normally use ChatGPT.** Focus on topics you'd typically ask about:

**Examples:**
- üìñ **Learning/School:** "Explain how neural networks work", "Help me understand photosynthesis", "What's the difference between REST and GraphQL?"
- üíº **Work:** "How do I write a professional email to decline a meeting?", "Explain agile methodology"
- ü§î **Curiosity:** "Why is the sky blue?", "How does blockchain work?", "What causes inflation?"
- üõ†Ô∏è **Problem-solving:** "Debug this code...", "How do I fix a leaky faucet?", "Recipe for pad thai"

**Goal:** Have at least **10 back-and-forth messages** on topics you're genuinely interested in learning about.

### Task 2: Explore Learn Mode

1. Click **"Learn"** in the top navigation
2. Click **"Refresh Suggestions"** button (top right)
3. Wait a few seconds while LOOM analyzes your chats
4. Review the suggested course topics
5. Click on a suggested topic to see the full course outline
6. Explore the modules, lessons, and quizzes

## üìù STEP 5: Feedback Survey

After testing, please answer these questions:

### Rate your experience (1 = Strongly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree):

1. The system's suggested topics were useful to my needs.
2. The suggestions repeated things I already knew. *(lower is better)*
3. The suggestions helped consolidate my prior knowledge.
4. The system introduced new information that expanded my knowledge.
5. The system identified gaps I would not have noticed on my own.
6. The length and depth of suggested lessons matched the time I usually spend learning.
7. The presented materials felt coherent and connected to my prior chats.
8. I trust the correctness of the suggested content.
9. I felt motivated to follow up after viewing the suggestions.
10. I would use this system again in my daily workflows.

### Open-ended questions:

11. **What did you like most** about the suggestions/materials?
12. **What would you change** to make suggestions/materials more useful?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Blank white screen?**
- Make sure you're running the local server (not just opening index.html)
- Check that you're at http://localhost:8080

**"API key required" error?**
- Go to Settings and add your Gemini API key

**Port 8080 already in use?**
- Try: `python3 -m http.server 8081` and open http://localhost:8081

**No suggestions appearing in Learn mode?**
- Make sure you've had at least 10 chat messages first
- Click "Refresh Suggestions" button
- Wait a few seconds for processing
